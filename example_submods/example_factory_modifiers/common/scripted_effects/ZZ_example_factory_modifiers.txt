# Example Submod: Factory Modifiers
# This example shows how to add factory RP modifiers based on ideas/spirits/focuses

# Hook: Apply factory modifiers
# This runs BEFORE factory RP calculation
# Use this to set multiplicative modifiers for factory types
dr_apply_factory_modifiers_submods = {
	# Example 1: Free Trade idea gives +10% civilian factory RP
	# The modifier is multiplicative: 0.10 = +10%
	if = {
		limit = { has_idea = free_trade }
		add_to_variable = { civilian_rp_modifier = 0.10 }
	}
	
	# Example 2: War Economy idea gives +15% military factory RP
	if = {
		limit = { has_idea = war_economy }
		add_to_variable = { military_rp_modifier = 0.15 }
	}
	
	# Example 3: Fictional "Naval Focus" idea gives +20% naval factory RP
	# Note: This idea doesn't exist in vanilla - replace with your own idea ID
	# if = {
	#   limit = { has_idea = naval_research_focus }
	#   add_to_variable = { naval_rp_modifier = 0.20 }
	# }
	
	# Example 4: Multiple modifiers can stack
	# If a country has both Free Trade and another idea, both modifiers apply
	# Example: Free Trade (+10%) + another idea (+5%) = +15% total
