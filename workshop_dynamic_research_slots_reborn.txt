[h1]Dynamic Research Slots Reborn[/h1]

[b]Research that grows with your industry instead of a fixed slot limit.[/b]  
In Reborn, your number of research slots is no longer static. Civilian factories, military factories, dockyards and experimental factories all generate [b]Research Power (RP)[/b]. When your RP crosses certain thresholds, you automatically unlock additional research slots. Starting slots and those gained through national focuses count as [b]Easy Research Slots[/b], which require less RP than slots earned purely through industry. In‑game decisions show your current RP, the next threshold, and a detailed help overview. A dedicated “Dynamic Research” tab under [i]Custom Game Rules[/i] lets you tailor the system to your liking.

[b]This mod is based on the discontinued Workshop mod “[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3605777399]Dynamic Research Slots[/url]” by [b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/crouchinglemur]Lemur[/url][/b]. Reborn updates and expands the original while staying true to its design philosophy.[/b]

[h2]What Reborn Adds[/h2]  
[list]  
[*][b]Dynamic Research Slots:[/b] Your research capacity scales with your economy instead of being locked behind a few focuses. Industrial growth becomes a meaningful research choice, not just a production one.  
[*][b]Expanded Custom Game Rules:[/b] Fine‑tune how many Easy Research Slots you get, how expensive new slots are in terms of RP, how different factory types contribute, and whether war or alliances affect RP income.  
[*][b]Experimental Factories:[/b] A new building type representing advanced labs and prototype workshops. It generates additional RP and unlocks decisions that further specialize your research game.  
[*][b]Optional Dynamic Modifiers:[/b] Make RP generation respond to your country’s laws, war status and alliance membership. These effects are [b]enabled by default[/b] but fully adjustable through Game Rules.  
[*][b]Clean, Script‑Based Implementation:[/b] Uses scripted effects, on_actions, decisions and game rules instead of overwriting vanilla research trees, which keeps compatibility high.  
[/list]

[h2]How It Works (Short Version)[/h2]  
[list]  
[*]Build civilian, military, dockyard and experimental factories to earn [b]Research Power[/b].  
[*]Cross RP thresholds to unlock new research slots over the course of the game.  
[*]Easy Research Slots (start + focus slots) are cheaper than purely industrial slots.  
[*]Decisions show your current RP, your next threshold and a full rules breakdown.  
[*]Use the “Dynamic Research” [i]Custom Game Rules[/i] tab to adjust the system globally before each game.  
[/list]

[h2]Custom Game Rules[/h2]  
[list]  
[*][b]Easy Slot Base & Scaling:[/b] Set how many Easy Research Slots exist and how much RP they cost relative to “hard” slots.  
[*][b]RP Cost Factors:[/b] Adjust how quickly RP thresholds grow so you can make research slots more generous or more demanding.  
[*][b]Factory Weighting:[/b] Control how much RP comes from civilian factories, military factories, dockyards and experimental factories.  
[*][b]War & Alliance Modifiers:[/b] Optionally increase or reduce RP gain while at war or when part of a faction, to reflect wartime pressure or shared knowledge.  
[*][b]Law‑Based Modifiers:[/b] Tie RP modifiers to your economic and conscription laws for a more “simulationist” approach, or disable them for a simpler setup.  
[/list]

[h2]Experimental Factories[/h2]  
Experimental Factories are a new building type that represents advanced labs, test facilities and prototype workshops. They are intentionally rare and powerful, giving you another strategic lever beyond standard industry.
[b]Additional RP Source:[/b] Each Experimental Factory provides extra Research Power on top of your regular factories.

[h2]Compatibility[/h2]  
[list]  
[*][b]Game Version:[/b] Tested with the current Hearts of Iron IV version. The underlying mechanics are intentionally generic and script‑based.  
[*][b]Content Mods:[/b] Does [i]not[/i] overwrite vanilla technology or focus trees. It relies on scripted effects, on_actions, decisions and game rules, so it should work with most national focus and content mods.  
[*][b]Overhaul Mods:[/b] Large overhauls that introduce their own dynamic research‑slot systems or heavily rewrite the research UI/mechanics may conflict. In case of doubt, load Reborn [b]after[/b] major overhauls and test.  
[*][b]Multiplayer:[/b] Fully usable in multiplayer; all configuration is done through Custom Game Rules before the session starts.
